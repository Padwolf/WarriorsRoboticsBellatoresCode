# 11300: Bellatores 

## Overview
This repository hold the code for FTC team 11300: Bellatores.

## Robot components
### Holonomic Drive
Our robot features a holonomic drive. Holonomic drive requires a square robot
with a set of four omniwheels mounted and four evenly distruibuted points
around the robot (i.e. the corners or the middle of the sides). For example:

 w1/	\w2
 
 w4\	/w3

### Arm
Our robot also features a arm mounted to a turn table in the center of the bot.
The design of this is still in progress. More information will be added as it is
decided.

## Benchmarks
#### October 5, 2017: Holonomic Base Working

We got the holonomic drive base and code working today. We spend a good amount
of time playing around with the robot. We were also pleasanty surprised to find
that it could occasionally get up on the balance pads. We plan to add something
like plates under the motor mounts, as we suspect that should enable it to get
up on the ramp every time.
